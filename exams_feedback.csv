Unable to implement logic for coding questions,written wrong answers in theory part,takes long time to submit assignments,trying to do problems but lack of practice ,sometimes bounce from out of concept and slow learner 
too slow to learn,not practicing problems ,little bit scared ,unable to implement logic,not even try to answer the questions while asking regarding subject
not even interested to sit exam room. ,too lazy ,no practice,like to take more breaks,always tell as health problem. not feel well........
like to take more breaks,CR works,unable to implement logic,lack of practice,used to try or attempt but not get solutions
irregular to class( always late comings),takes more leaves,not interested to practice,careless towards course,"if tried hard can solve problems, but not interested to do that"

didn't know how to read the input,He is not listening to the videos with concentration. gets distracted with mobile phone.,"weak in logical thinking, doesnot put efforts to practice more problems.","Asks doubts , but most of the time he doesn't complete the  program and moves to solve another program",Did not practice the model paper given for the exam as he was absent on the previous day of the exam

Slow Learner,Getting Confused in Exams while solving.,Wasn't able to solve boundary test cases(Solves problem but cannot pass last one or two test cases).,None,None
Slow learner.,In exam while solving cannot remove errors if occurred.,In exam cannot pass boundary test cases.,None,None
He is a slow learner. I observed in the last courses that he will take some time to adjust with the course. after that he will perform better.,He will spend more time on reading the concept rather than practice.,He won't move to next topics unless he understand a single topic. so the pending works for him will be more.,last week he is absent for 1.5 days out of 4 days which effects his performance.,"He is a weak in tracing of code, so even he is conceptually good he can't find his own errors in his code"

Health is not well,trying to do problems but lack of practice,like to take more breaks,using mobile in lab,takes more time to understand concepts 
using mobile in lab,doing soft skill work in morning it time,sleeping in lab and saying headache,sometimes youtube stuff,trying to do problems but lack of practice
He is a slow learner and need some time to adjust with the course once he adjust with the course he will perform better.,works hard on last two days of exam. but not from the first day.,"Tracing is the main drawback 
I saw his week-1 code he made some mistakes which are very easy to identify in tracing.",His practise time not sufficient for him as he is a slow learner. He need to practice more.,He spends more time on readings concepts rather than practice.
